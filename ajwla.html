            Many rural and remote areas still need to have suitable means to access information over internet and telecom network. With a little more than 500 million users still a lot needs to be done. Access internet in urban areas is more than 50% than that in rural areas. The lack of infrastructure, availability of bandwidth and digital literacy schemes information reaches to masses online easily, government of India (GoI) launched Digital India Campaign in July 2015, connecting rural areas over high speed internet connection to bring the remote areas of the country into mainstream and improve digital literacy is the ambitious objective of the campaign.
